	<p><font color="orange" face="arial" size="4">The <i>Decline of Western Civilization</i> is a 1981 American documentary filmed through 1979 and 1980. The movie is about the Los Angeles punk rock scene and was directed by Penelope Spheeris. In 1981, the LAPD Chief of Police Daryl Gates wrote a letter demanding the film not be shown again in the city.[1]</font></p>
	<p><font color="#FF4500" face="verdana" size="4">The film's title is possibly a reference to music critic <u><i>Lester Bangs' 1970 two-part review of the Stooges' album Fun House,</i></u> for Creem magazine, where Bangs quotes a friend who had said the popularity of the Stooges signaled <i>"the decline of Western civilization".</i> Another possibility is that the title refers to Darby Crash's reading of Oswald Spengler's Der Untergang des Abendlandes (The Decline of the West).[2] In <i>We Got the Neutron Bomb</i>, an <b>oral history</b> of the L.A. punk rock scene collected by Marc Spitz, Claude Bessy claims that he came up with the title.[3]</font></p>
